Whether you're a Computer Science (or related) college graduate, a recent bootcamp grad, or a self-taught software developer trying to get a job, practicing for a real technical interview can be very difficult.  You can read Cracking the Coding Interview, and practice on various coding problem websites (Leetcode, CodeWars, HackerRank, etc), but until you go through the actual experience of doing it on a video or in-person when the clock is against you, you never quite know how you will react.

A month ago, I took the advice of other software engineers and tried out Pramp.  Pramp pairs you with another software developer that is (most likely) interviewing as well, and gives you each a techical problem that will appear on the shared screen.  Pramp allows you to pick your programming language, and since Pramp will send you a preview of the question your partner will get on the call, it's okay if your partner is a at a higher skill level than you.  You can take a look at the problem beforehand so you understand it better, and Pramp gives you hints to guide them, and the answer if needed. 

While I thought I would be just fine in a technical interview, you never really know until you do it.  I got a question about trees - an algorithmic topic that I don't have a ton of practice in - and I was unsure about the syntax for these at points.  Luckily, my partner was a more experienced engineer than I was, and provided me hints of his own before giving the provided hints from Pramp.  I was determined for him to not give me the answer, and to only take direction from him instead of him just giving me the answer.  I am grateful for his patience as I went over the allotted amount of time, but made sure I was truly understanding the concepts on my way to the correct answer.

Now, this is a resource I cannot rave enough about, and continue to use.  I do believe that if you haven't completed at least 10+ of these Pramp interviews before your real technical interviews, you're taking a poorly calculated risk instead of putting your future in your own hands as much as possible.  

Check out Pramp (I swear I have no affiliation with them other than being a user), and good luck!
